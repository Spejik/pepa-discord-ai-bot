## Getting started

1. Run `pnpm i` and start with `pnpm run start`
2. Get a model.  
   Some that work well are [Luna AI Llama2 Uncensored](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GGUF) or [OpenHermes Mistral](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF)
3. Run [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) Local Inference Server.  
   Make sure the model has correct settings and prompt formatting preset.  
   You should also increase the number of cpu threads. (default is 4, 10-14 works fine)
